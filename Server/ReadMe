Body-parser is a middleware in Node.js used for parsing incoming request bodies. It allows you to extract the entire request body from an HTTP request and exposes it on the req.body property.
Helmet is a popular security middleware package for Node.js and Express.js applications. It helps protect your application from various web vulnerabilities by setting appropriate HTTP headers.

# Storage of File

When a file is uploaded, multer will use this storage configuration to determine where to save the file and what name to give it.
The destination option specifies that uploaded files should be saved in the ./public directory. This directory is typically accessible to the web server and can be used to serve files to clients.
The filename option specifies that the uploaded file should be saved with its original filename. This is a common approach, but you can customize the filename if needed.
